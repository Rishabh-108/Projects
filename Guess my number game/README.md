ðŸŸ¢The live implementation of the project can be found here: [Guess-my-number](https://guess-my-num-rishabh.netlify.app/)

# Details:

The guess my number game can be played in the following way:

1. A secret number between 1 and 20 is generated every time a new game is started.
2. As the name suggests the user has to guess the that secret number.
3. You start out with a score of 20 by default, and with every wrong guess, 1 point is deducted from the score.
4. As feedback for each guess, the user will recieve either a 'Too High' or 'Too Low' depending on the guess.
5. When they guess the number correctly, then they win and that sets the current score as the new highscore.
6. The highscore persists accross all games while the webpage is open.
