The pig game is a two-player game and can be played in the following way:

1. The player 1 begins the game and can roll the dice via the 'Roll Dice' button.
2. There are only 6 possible outcomes when the dice is rolled, that is, receiving a number from 1 to 6.
3. Every time the player rolls the dice the returned dice value is added to their current score.
4. If the player rolls a '1' then they will forfeit their turn and also their entire score, that is, their score will be set to 0.
5. The active player can change in 2 situations:
   5.1. The player can choose to hold their current score via the 'Hold' button. If done so, the current score will be transferred to the above displayed overall score and the other player will have a turn to roll the dice.
   5.2. If the player rolls a '1', then the current active player forfeits their turn and their score is set 0.
6. To WIN the game, a player must achieve an overall score over 100. Once that is achieved, the game ends and a new game must be started.
7. The players may start a new game at any time during their play.
